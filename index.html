          <h3 class = "faq-question">What is a mortgage?</h3>
          <p class = "faq-answer">
            A mortgage is the amount of money you took out
            in loans to pay for the cost of a house that you are
            required to pay back monthly for a set period of
            time. Think of it as a fancy word for saying “house
            loan.”

          <h3 class = "faq-question">What is a downpayment?</h3>
          <p class = "faq-answer">
            A down payment is the amount of money you have
            that you can pay for the house without taking out
            a loan. In other words, it’s the amount of cash you
            have in your bank that you can use to pay for the
            house before taking out a mortgage to pay for the
            remaining cost of the house.

          <h3 class = "faq-question">What is a mortgage rate?</h3>
          <p class = "faq-answer">
            A mortgage rate is the interest rate charged on
            your home loan.

          <h3 class = "faq-question">What is the repayment period?</h3>
          <p class = "faq-answer">
            The repayment period is the total time length you
            are expected to be able to pay off your entire
            mortgage by. This number can vary, but the most
            common numbers are 15 years and 30 years.
