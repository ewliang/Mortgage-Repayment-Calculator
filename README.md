# Mortgage-Repayment-Calculator
A simple mortgage repayment calculator. I made this just to practice my web design UI skills and to play around with Javascript. I made a requirement for myself so that I will not be allowed to use Bootstrap to make it mobile friendly. Everything has to be 100% vanilla.
